# **Why**

I decided to build **MarketHub** after several real freelance projects revealed a clear pattern:
many small businesses and independent sellers wanted to showcase their products online, but **didn’t need a full e-commerce system with integrated payments**.

What they actually asked for was simple:

> “I just want a place to display my products and let customers contact me directly.”

This gap between traditional e-commerce solutions and what small sellers truly needed inspired me to create a **user-driven marketplace** where:

* Any registered user can publish their products
* Buyers can express interest or contact sellers directly
* Sellers receive notifications about new potential buyers
* Payments can be optional (via Stripe) instead of mandatory

MarketHub is designed to solve a **real-world problem**:
giving independent sellers a lightweight, flexible platform to promote their products **without the overhead of a full online store**, while still offering modern features like dashboards, product management, real-time notifications, and category/tag filtering.

The project combines my real freelance experience with a scalable technical design, turning a common request from small clients into a complete, mid-level production-ready marketplace system.
